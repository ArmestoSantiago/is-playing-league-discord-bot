"Is Playing League?" has arrived to make it easier for League of Legends users to check if any summoner is currently playing and with which champion, view their own statistics, popular champion builds, and the statistics of the allies and opponents they have been matched with.
From the comfort of your preferred Discord server, all you need to do is type a command, and Is Playing League? BOT will provide you with the information you requested.

Future features:

- Recommended builds for champions.


- User match history within Discord.


- Statistics of allies and enemies.
